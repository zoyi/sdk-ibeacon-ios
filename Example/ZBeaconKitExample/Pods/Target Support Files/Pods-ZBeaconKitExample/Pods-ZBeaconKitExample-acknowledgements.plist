This is an agreement between you and ZOYI Corporation (“ZOYI”), a Korean corporation
located at 15th Floor, 141 Teheran-ro, Gangnam-gu (KR Tower), Seoul, Korea, regarding 
your use of the SDK and any associated documentation or other materials for Walk Insights 
as made available by ZOYI (collectively, the "SDK"). This agreement applies to any 
updates or supplements for the SDK, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, 
those other terms apply.

By installing, accessing or otherwise using the SDK, you accept the terms of this 
agreement. If you do not agree to the terms of this agreement, do not install, 
access or use the SDK.

If you agree to comply with this agreement, you have the rights below.
(1) USE OF THE SDK. Subject to your compliance with this agreement, ZOYI hereby 
authorizes you to use the SDK solely for the purpose of creating mobile applications 
designed to operate with Walk Insights (referred to as "Authorized Applications"). 
You may not rent, lease or lend any of your rights in the SDK or access to Walk Insights. You may make a reasonable number of copies of the SDK for the purposes set 
forth herein, provided that you reproduce only complete copies, including without 
limitation all "read me" files, copyright notices, and other legal notices and 
terms that ZOYI has included in the SDK.

(2) SCOPE OF LICENSE. The SDK is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives 
you some rights to use the SDK. ZOYI specifically does not grant any express or 
implied rights under its copyright, patents or other intellectual property with 
respect to your Authorized Applications. In doing so, you must comply with any 
technical limitations in the SDK that only allow you to use it in certain ways. 
You may not: (a) reverse engineer, decompile, distribute or disassemble the SDK, 
except and only to the extent that applicable law expressly permits; or (b) make 
more copies of the SDK than specified in this agreement, except and only to the 
extent applicable law expressly permits; or (c) publish the SDK for others to 
copy; or (d) rent, lease or lend the SDK.

(3) USE OF THE SERVICES. Your use of ZBeaconKit, and the use of ZBeaconKit 
by anyone hosting or using your Authorized Application, is governed by the 
then-current Terms of Services (“TOS”) for Walk Insights which can be found

(4) FEEDBACK. By submitting feedback to ZOYI, either via email at [feedback@zoyi.io]

transferable, royalty-free license to use your feedback for any and all purposes 
without any compensation to you.

(5) TERMINATION. ZOYI reserves the right to discontinue offering the SDK or 
to modify the SDK at any time in its sole discretion. 
This Section and Sections 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 will survive termination 
of this agreement or any discontinuation of the offering of the SDK along with any other provisions that would reasonably be deemed to survive 
such events.

(6) RESERVATION OF RIGHTS. You are not authorized to alter, modify, copy, edit, 
format, create derivative works of or otherwise use any materials, content or 
technology provided under this agreement except as explicitly provided in this 
agreement or approved in advance in writing by ZOYI.

(7) MODIFICATIONS; NOTICES. If we change this contract, then we will give you 
notice before the change is in force. If you do not agree to these changes, 
then you must cancel and stop using the SDK before the changes are in force. 
If you do not stop using the SDK, then your use of the SDK will 
continue under the changed contract. ZOYI may give notices to you, at ZOYI's 
option, by posting on any portion of [ZOYI.co] or by electronic mail to any 
e-mail address provided by you to ZOYI.

(8) ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and any applicable TOS or contract for 
Walk Insights, are the entire agreement with respect to the SDK.

(9) APPLICABLE LAW AND VENUE. Korean law governs the interpretation of this 
agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of 
laws principles. You agree that any action brought under this agreement will 
be subject to exclusive jurisdiction of the Seoul Central District Court.

of using it. ZOYI gives no express or implied warranties, guarantees or conditions. 
You may have additional consumer rights under your local laws which this 
agreement cannot change. To the extent permitted under your local laws, ZOYI 
excludes the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
